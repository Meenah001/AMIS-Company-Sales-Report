# Introduction

In order to know the best location to build a new branch of AMIS company, an analysis was carried out on the dataset given for this to be achieved. The problem satatement is an imaginary case scenario I thought about after seeing the dataset.

---

# Problem Statement

An international company in Canada known as AMIS COMPANY wish to build a new branch of their office in a location where the highest sales has been made. At the board meeting, the stakeholders made a conclusion of awarding the salesrep that made the highest sales as the Manager of the new branch, also to give discount to the customer that has made the highest purchase.

In order to achieve this, three questions need answers:

1. Which Region/location was the highest sales made? 

2. Which Sales Rep has made the highest sales?

3. Which of our Customers purchased highest sales?

The dataset is an excel file saved locally in a folder. The dataset was denormalised, that is all data are in a single table and this is not ideal for carrying out analysis

---

# Data sourcing

The data was normalised that is, the combined information was seperated into different tables resulting into 5 tables:
* Sales Table
* Customers Table
* Sales Reps Table
* Location Table
* Products Table

Data was then imported from Excel Workbook into Power BI for transformation, analysis and visualization.

# Data Transformation 

Data cleaning and transformation was performed per table. All the tables are then cleaned with no errors or null values. Below is a preview of each tables:

Customer's Table

The first rows were not headers and this was solved by applying the "Use First row as header" in power query. The datatypes for each column was also changed accordingly.

Location's Table

Product Table

The "ProductID" and "Product Name" were seen to be in the same column. In order to make them be in different columns, the command 'Split column by delimeter" was used and our aim to get two different column was achieved.

For both Customers and Products Table, first rows were not headers and this was solved by applying the "Use First row as header" in power query. The datatypes for each column was also changed accordingly

# Data Modelling

The data for this analysis are located in various tables. For this reason, appropriate modelling is required. A star Schema is designed with the Sales Table representing the fact table containing all redundant data, and to which other dimension tables are connected to, using the column that is common. Sales Table has been modelled with:

* SalesRep Table using the "SalesRep ID"
* Locations Table using the "Location ID"
* Products Table using "Product ID"
* Customers Tables via "Customer ID"

# Total Sales and Profit made by Region

The company has four region in which it sales are focused on, and these are the West, East, Central and South. The image above make it clear that the West had the highest sales of $3,595,227 and the South with the lowest sales of $2,037,675. It is also seen that Western region has made the highest profit so far, with about $532,832 follow by the Eastern region having $450,546 profit. The Central region had the lowest profit of $219,604

# Profit by Category of product

# Total Sales made by each SalesReps

Something seems not to be right here. "ORGANIC" is definitely an outlier. After making more enquiries from the stakeholders, I got to know that the term "Organic" refers to sales made without the help of the salesreps and should thus be excluded:

After getting rid of the outlier which is the "Organic" from the data, the correct hierarchy of the salesReps in correlation with sales made is shown above, this help us to know the salesRep with the highest sales. As seen above, Morris Garcia had the highest sales of $473,719 and Jessicca Smith had the lowest sales of $257,565

# Sales by Segment

Apparently, Sean Miller happens to be the customer with the highest purchase of the company product. He has made a purchase of $142,359

# Total Sales made over the years

The highest sales was made in the year 2017, with total sales of $3,584,819 and the lowest sales was recorded in the year 2014, having total sales of $2,468,283

---

# Conclusion and Recommendations

* West Region is the appropriate location to build the new branch of the company, because it has the highest sales and made the highest profit over the years

* Morris Garcia should be the Sales Manager for the new branch of the company, as she has shown her been devoted to the company's  sales by making the highest sales amongst her colleagues. Therefore, she should be appreciated by making her the Manager to new Office

* Sean Miller is the most precious customer at the moment and needs to be compensated either by an award or considerable discounts on subsequent purchase of any of the company's products
