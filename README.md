# AMIS-Company-Sales-Report

# Introduction
In order to know the best location to build a new branch of AMIS company, an analysis was carried out on the dataset given for this to be achieved.The problem satatement is an imaginary case scenario I thought about after seeing the dataset.

# Problem Statement

An international company in Canada known as AMIS COMPANY wish to build a new branch of their office in a location where the highest sales has been made. At the board meeting, the stakeholders made a conclusion of awarding the salesrep that made the highest sales as the Manager of the new branch, also to give discount to the customer that has made the highest purchase.

In order to achieve this, three questions need answers:
1. Which Region/location has the highest sales made?
2. Which Sales rep has made the highest sales?
3. Which of our Customers purchased highest sales?

The dataset is an excel file saved locally in a folder. The dataset is denormalised, that is all data are in a single table and this is not ideal for carrying out analysis

# Data sourcing
The data was normalised that is, the combined information was seperated into differnt tables resulting into 5 tables:
* Sales Table
* Customers Table
* Sales Reps Table
* Location Table
* Products Table

Data was then imported from Excel Workbook into Power BI for transformation, analysis and visualization.
